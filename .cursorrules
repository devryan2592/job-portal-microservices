3. Coding Standards

Programming Style:
    - Prioritize functional and declarative programming paradigms.
    - Minimize the use of classes; favor functional components and hooks.
    - Write concise, readable, and well-documented code.
    - Use meaningful variable and function names.

Type Safety:
    - Utilize TypeScript throughout the project for enhanced type safety and code maintainability.
    - Define clear and concise type definitions for all components, interfaces, and data structures.

Performance:
    - Optimize for performance where necessary, but prioritize code readability and maintainability first.
    - Utilize techniques like memoization, lazy loading, and code splitting to improve performance.
    - Leverage browser caching and efficient data fetching strategies.

Error Handling:
    - Implement robust error handling mechanisms throughout the application.
    - Use try-catch blocks and error boundaries to gracefully handle unexpected errors.
    - Provide informative error messages to users.

Testing:
    - Write comprehensive unit tests and integration tests for all critical components.
    - Utilize testing frameworks like Jest or Mocha.
    - Implement continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines.

Security:
    - Implement appropriate security measures to protect user data and prevent vulnerabilities.
    - Validate all user inputs and sanitize data before processing.
    - Use HTTPS for secure communication.

4. Framework-Specific Guidelines

Backend (Node.js & Express.js)
    - Adhere to RESTful API design principles.
    - Implement middleware for authentication, authorization, and request logging.
    - Use appropriate HTTP status codes for API responses.

Swagger:
    - Use Swagger to document the API endpoints, request/response parameters, and data models.
    - Generate interactive API documentation from Swagger definitions.

Frontend (Next.js App Router)
    - Leverage the Next.js App Router for a more flexible and performant routing system.
    - Utilize React Server Components (RSC) where appropriate to improve performance and reduce client-side JavaScript.
    - Follow the App Router's conventions for nested layouts, data fetching, and client-side navigation.

Mobile (React Native & Expo)
    - Follow React Native best practices for component development and styling.
    - Utilize Expo SDK for platform-specific features and services.
    - Optimize performance for both iOS and Android platforms.

5. Documentation

Project Documentation: Maintain a comprehensive project documentation that includes:
    - Project overview and goals
    - Architecture diagrams
    - API documentation (generated from Swagger)
    - Deployment instructions
    - Contributing guidelines

Code Documentation:
    - Use JSDoc or similar tools to document all functions, components, and classes.
    - Write clear and concise comments within the code to explain complex logic.

6. Code Reviews

    - Conduct regular code reviews to ensure code quality, maintainability, and adherence to these guidelines.
    - Encourage open and constructive feedback during code reviews.
